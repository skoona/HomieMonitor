#
#  Both :locale and :translations can be configured (overridden) during plugin configuration:
#
#     plugin :i18n, :locale => ['de'], :translations => ['absolute/path/2/i18n']
# ##
#    USAGE
#
#    The i18n plugin depends upon simple YAML based translations files:
#
#     # app/i18n/en.yml
#
#    user:
#      edit: Edit user
#      name: User name is %1
#      count: !!pl
#        1: There is 1 user
#        n: There are %1 users
#    ...and the :t instance method to output the translations:
#
#    t.user.edit         #=> "Edit user"
#    t.user.name('John') #=> "User name is John"
#    t.user.count(5)     #=> "There are 5 users"
#
#    t.does.not.exist | 'default' #=> "default"
#    ...and the :l (lowercase L) instance method provides built-in localisations support:
#
#    l Time.now           #=> "03/01/2010 18:54"
#    l Time.now, :human   #=> "now"
#    l Time.now, :full    #=> "3rd of January, 2010 18:54"
#    Both the :t and :l methods are available within the route and template (erb) scopes. ie:
#
#    route do |r|
#      r.root do
#        t.welcome.message
#      end
#    end
#
#     # app/views/layout.erb
#     <snip...>
#       <h1><%= t.welcome.message %></h1>
#     <snip...>
